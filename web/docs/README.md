# Documentation

This folder is the central place for product documentation, the PRD, and testing notes.

- `docs/prd/` — place PRD PDFs or markdown files here (the team can upload a PDF and reference it here).
- `docs/tests.md` — test cases and test notes.
- `docs/process.md` — optional process docs (release, deploy, PR checklist).
