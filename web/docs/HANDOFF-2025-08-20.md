# Handoff — 2025-08-20

This document captures the workspace state and the next steps to continue work tomorrow.

## Snapshot
- Date: 2025-08-20
- Repository path: `C:\sandbox\teamopshq\web`
- Current branch: `feature/prisma-add-item-fields`

## High-level summary
Work today focused on adding type-aware element creation and UI behavior:
- The element create form now shows type-specific fields (note, event, task, journal, decision).
- The client sends a structured `detailsJson` payload with type-specific properties to `/api/elements`.
- Optimistic creation flow implemented: provisional item emitted then replaced when the server responds.
- Elements list UI updated to show type-specific summaries and a simple "(pending)" badge for provisional items.
- Server `/api/elements` POST updated to accept and persist `detailsJson` and create a `CalendarEvent` when event details contain start/end times.
- `getPrisma()` shim is used in API route(s) to avoid transient TypeScript/Prisma typing issues during migration.

## Files of interest (changed/added)
- `src/app/elements/ClientCreateElementForm.tsx`
  - Client element creation form. Now shows type-specific fields and builds `detailsJson` for POST. Implements optimistic provisional creation.
- `src/app/elements/ElementsClient.tsx`
  - Client list + create wrapper. Renders list entries with type-specific summary details and pending badge.
- `src/app/api/elements/route.ts`
  - API GET/POST handlers. POST now accepts `detailsJson` and creates `calendarEvent` when event details include start/end.
- `src/lib/getPrisma.ts`
  - Helper returning `prisma as any` to centralize pragmatic typing; used where Prisma client methods don't type-check cleanly yet.

(Also recent related files in previous work: Dexie migration, QuickNote updates, API sync/uploads updates — check repo history if needed.)

## How to run (local)
Open PowerShell and run from the web directory. These commands assume you have pnpm and node installed.

1) Install (if you haven't already):

```powershell
Set-Location 'C:\sandbox\teamopshq\web'
pnpm install
```

2) Type-check the project (fast sanity check):

```powershell
Set-Location 'C:\sandbox\teamopshq\web'
pnpm -s tsc --noEmit
```

3) Start the dev server (foreground so you can see logs):

```powershell
Set-Location 'C:\sandbox\teamopshq\web'
pnpm dev
```

4) Quick API check (separate terminal):

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing http://localhost:3000/api/elements -TimeoutSec 10 | Select-Object -Expand Content
```

5) Example POST to create a task using `detailsJson` (PowerShell):

```powershell
$body = @{
  type = 'task'
  title = 'Follow up with team'
  detailsJson = @{
    $type = 'task'
    $v = 1
    body_md = 'Send project updates'
    status = 'open'
    priority = 'high'
    dueAt = '2025-08-25'
  }
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10

Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri http://localhost:3000/api/elements -Body $body -ContentType 'application/json'
```

## Observed runtime notes
- The dev server in this environment emitted a warning about multiple lockfiles. If you see `⚠ Warning: Found multiple lockfiles. Selecting ... pnpm-lock.yaml`, you can ignore it or remove the duplicate lockfile at `web/pnpm-lock.yaml` if desired.
- The code uses a temporary `getPrisma()` shim to avoid TypeScript Prisma client typing issues. This is intentional during migration and should be removed once the schema and client are stabilized.

## Known gaps / TODOs (recommended next work)
1. Remove `getPrisma()` shim and restore properly-typed Prisma usage (priority: high).
   - Re-generate Prisma client (`pnpm prisma generate`) after finalizing schema, then replace `getPrisma()` usages.
   - Run `pnpm -s tsc --noEmit` to find and fix remaining type errors.

2. UX polish for optimistic create (priority: medium).
   - Show a spinner/inline loader for provisional items instead of plain text `(pending)`.
   - Provide a retry button when server replacement fails.
   - Disable form or show success toast while saving.

3. Validation and small client-side checks (priority: medium).
   - Validate event date ranges (endsAt >= startsAt), and ensure dates parse safely.
   - Validate required fields per type (e.g., tasks might require title or due date depending on rules).

4. Tests (priority: medium).
   - Add API tests (vitest) for `/api/elements` POST/GET, including event -> CalendarEvent creation.
   - Add component/unit tests for the form and optimistic flow (or Playwright e2e for the create+list flow).

5. Accessibility and UX review (priority: low).
   - Ensure form labels and interactions meet a11y basics.

## Troubleshooting hints
- If the dev server fails to start or exits quickly, run it in the foreground and paste the logs here; I can debug startup/runtime errors.
- If elements created in the UI don't persist, check the API response in browser devtools Network tab; the server returns { element } on success.
- If TypeScript reports missing Prisma properties after `prisma` usage is restored, re-run `pnpm prisma generate` and re-type or fix the model/usage.

## Quick status mapping (requirements -> status)
- Type-aware create form UI: Done
- detailsJson payload persisted by API: Done
- Optimistic provisional create + replacement: Done
- Elements list shows type-specific summaries: Done
- Remove transient TypeScript casts (`getPrisma()`): Pending
- Add tests for API and optimistic UI: Pending

## Useful places to look in the codebase
- Create form and client: `src/app/elements/ClientCreateElementForm.tsx`, `src/app/elements/ElementsClient.tsx`
- API: `src/app/api/elements/route.ts`
- Prisma models: `prisma/schema.prisma` and `prisma/dev.db` (if using sqlite local)
- Dexie/IndexedDB code (client offline sync): `src/lib/dexie.ts` and `src/components/SyncManager.tsx` (if present)

## Next action I recommend you take tomorrow
1. Pull latest from the current branch and run the dev server locally. Confirm the create form displays types and that POSTs persist elements.
2. Run `pnpm -s tsc --noEmit` and fix any TypeScript issues before removing the `getPrisma()` shim.
3. Implement one UX polish (pending spinner or retry) and add one small test for element POST/GET.

If you'd like, I can start with step 1 (start the dev server and capture logs) or step 2 (remove `getPrisma()` and fix type errors). Tell me which and I will continue.
